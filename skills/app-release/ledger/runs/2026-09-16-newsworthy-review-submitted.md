# Newsworthy — historical App Review milestone

Updated: 2026-09-16T04:55:59+00:00

Repository: https://github.com/astrojams1/newsworthy

Objective: Release iOS and Android publicly as a one-time US$1 paid download with local equivalents, preserving the web app.

Historical extraction for skill v1.0.1. For current status, read the [canonical app ledger](https://github.com/astrojams1/newsworthy/blob/main/store/ledger.json). This new snapshot preserves the earlier handoff unchanged; it is not live provider evidence. Names were removed from copied evidence without changing gate outcomes.
